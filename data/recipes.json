        "ingredients": [
            "3 cups gluten-free flour blend (Use Cup4Cup for best results)",
            "2 tablespoons granulated sugar",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 cup unsalted butter, cubed and cold (or just grate with a box grater or cheese grater)",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/2 cup cold buttermilk",
            "3/4 lb ground beef",
            "1 small sweet onion, diced",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",

            "1 teaspoon minced garlic",
            "1-2 tablespoon ketchup",
            "1/2 cup shredded cheddar & Colby Jack cheese (1/4 cup of each) - Or whatever cheese you prefer!",
            "1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon salt (more/less, to taste)",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 large egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the dough first, so it has time to chill while you prepare the filling. Place the butter in the freezer so it is extra cold when time to add to your pastry dough.",
            "Add the gluten-free flour blend, Kosher salt, and sugar to a large and whisk to combine. Add the cold, cubed butter and using a pastry cutter or a fork, combine the butter with the dry ingredients. You can use your hands too! Mix until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Create a well (a large hole) in the center of the flour mixture, and set aside.",
            "In a small bowl, combine the egg and buttermilk with a fork and whisk. Slowly add the buttermilk and egg to the well you have created in the flour mixture, gradually whisking the egg with a fork, combining small amounts of flour at a time. Continue mixing until the dough thickens, and form into a ball (you can use your hands again!) Be patient, and keep mixing, the dough should form into a ball and eventually you won't be able to use a spoon and will have to use you hands!",
            "Wrap tightly in plastic wrap (or for a greener alternative, Bees Wrap). Allow dough to rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling. You can also leave it overnight and make the empanadas the next day.",
            "While the dough rests, prepare the filling. In a frying pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add chopped onions and saute for 4-5 minutes. Add the ground beef, oregano, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Saute until the ground beef is browned completely. Drain the fat and return the beef and onion mixture to the frying pan on low heat.",
            "Add the minced garlic and ketchup, continuing to saute on low heat for 3-4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. Off heat, add the shredded cheese, and mix until all combined. Set aside to cool.",
            "Once the dough has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and cut it in half. Keep the half not used in the refrigerator to stay cool. Give the dough 10-15 minutes to come to room temperature, or it will be very difficult to manipulate. Line two baking sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment paper (or for a greener alternative, use silicone mats). Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.",
            "Lightly (remember, don't use too much flour) flour a clean surface using Cup4Cup (or your gluten-free flour of choice) and roll the dough into a circular shape about ⅛ inch thick.",
            "To make small empanadas, use a drinking glass or a round cutter with a 3-inch diameter to cut holes in the dough. If you would prefer to make larger empanadas, use a larger cutter (about 6-inch diameter) or make your own circles of whatever size you like! Place circles on lined baking sheets. Take the pieces that remain and work them together, rolling them out again and repeating steps 6 and 7 until no dough remains.",
            "Place about 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each circle. Using the eggwash and a pastry brush, brush one side of the circle, then fold over one side to create a half-circle and seal them together. Crimp the edges together with a fork for a decorative touch.",
            "Using a small knife, cut a slit approximately ¼-inch long on the top center of each empanada, to allow steam to escape.",
            "Brush the empanadas with more egg wash and bake in the oven for 20-22 minutes until golden brown. Continue the same process with the remaining dough and filling."
